This project analyzes a Netflix dataset containing detailed information about movies and TV shows available on the platform. Each entry includes a unique ID, title, type (movie or TV show), director, cast, country of production, release year, and the date it was added to Netflix. Additional attributes include rating (e.g., TV-MA, PG), total duration (in minutes or number of seasons), and genre classification listed in the "listed_in" field. The dataset also provides a short description for each title.
Using this data, the project aims to uncover insights such as the most common genres, the distribution of content types over the years, the countries with the most content on Netflix, and how content duration varies between movies and TV shows. With tools like Power BI and BigQuery, raw data is transformed into clear and interactive dashboards. The project also supports skill development in data preparation, exploratory analysis, and storytelling with data.
